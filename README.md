### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

While I sometimes create tiny open source npm packages to make my life easier or just to have fun, I'm primarily a team lead, software architect, and application developer. Applying best practices, balancing tradeoffs, and keeping long-term maintenance in mind is the name of the game.
